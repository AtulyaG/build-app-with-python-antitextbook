## Who is this tutorial for?
This book is not for a completely noob programmer, it expects _some_ initial programming experience, if you are completely new to programming, we recommend learning the C programming language before jumping ship to Python.

## What is this?
This book is an easy to understand introduction to the Python programming language by using examples. You will build a command line todo list manager after you understand the basics of the language. Please have a Python 3 interpreter with you because you'll need to run code as you read! 

## Why Python?
There are a large number of languages out there and new ones coming out every week, thus, it begs the question _why learn Python_ over X. 

Python has the following advantages:

1. Easy to understand syntax. Reads just like English.
1. Huge community.
1. Open source hence millions of packages available.
1. Programs are typically short in number of lines.

A programming language's usability is direct proportion to the size of its community, this is because the core team writes the language, but the content(books,podcasts, tutorials, packages) surrounding the language is created by the community.

## Which Python?
This guide focuses only on Python3, Python2 is on life support and we do not recommend using it, unless there is an exceptional scenario.

## Writing Style

We have thirteen chapters:

* Each chapter or topic has an associated YouTube screencast. 
* Each chapter has concepts explained by an example (can be as stupid as 1+1=2)
* Code that is supposed to run on the Interpreter starts with `>>>` like `>>> not True`. 
```Python
>>> not True
	False
```
In this case, `>>> not True` is the statement and `False` is the output.
* Code that doesn't start with `>>>` is supposed to be run in a file of the extension .py
* If there is significant code for the chapter, you can find a file in the code repository, please look on the basis of chapters.

## How to use?
* Read the chapters end to end.
* Watch the YouTube screencast, there is a reason why they are free!
* Do NOT search the Internet for things like "how to do X in python", use the documentation.

## Installation

1. Linux and Mac: Use a package manager to install the python3 package.

1. Windows: Download the `.msi` or `.exe` file from https://python.org, run the installer, click on Next Next until it finishes.

1. Android:	Install `termux` (https://termux.com/help.html) & run `apt-get install python3` to install python inside it.

## Background
This tutorial is the culmination of the Python trainings I have given in the past. When I was taking the, I wanted the participants to refer to a tutorial which would be light weight yet effective, one which would explain concepts by example and still not overwhelm the reader who is new to Python (but not to programming). 

Of course, there are many many tutorials, I was asked on Reddit, so why a new one? It is because this is the tutorial I wished I had when I was learning Python, so I wouldn't have had to read the documentation ten times!

Please note that I don't profess to be a God at anything, but I do feel that good things happen when a group comes together for one goal. 

This is an open source guide and I invite you to contribute.

## Multiversity
This guide is a part of the [Multiversity](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/multiversity) initiative. The aim is to have high quality open source tutorials along with screencasts.

## Contribution
We need your help to become a great guide! All contributions are welcome. Please raise an issue on Github!
