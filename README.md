# Build applications in Python the anti-textbook

This tutorial aims to teach Python3 via example. It accompanies the [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL41psiCma00wwvtQyLFMFpzWxUYmSZwZy), the [code](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/code-build-app-with-python-antitextbook) accompanies this tutorial.

## Background
This tutorial is the culmination of the Python trainings I have given in the past. As I took the trainings, I found out that a lot of newcomers coming to Python are overwhelmed by the existing tutorials and books.

There are many guides for Python, but I never did find a guide which explained me by example and didn't overwhelm me with everything. As someone said, "If your dream book hasn't been written, write it!", hence I started to write this guide. 

I don't profess that I am an expert in Python, I am having decent knowledge of it, I just happen to LOVE Python, it has made me a better programmer and a better person, there was a time when I used to wish for having access to my home in Python, I could do, home.find("remote")and get the location of my tv remote :-D (I don't own or watch TV, but you get the point). Since this tutorial is open source on [Github](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/build-app-with-python-antitextbook) along with the [code](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/code-build-app-with-python-antitextbook), my mistakes can be rectified!

It was my dream to write a tutorial on Python ever since I got introduced to the language, purely by accident some six years ago. Finally, I was able to write it! 

## Multiversity
This guide is a part of the multiversity initiative. The plan is to write FOSS (Free as in Freedom) example based guides which also have supporting screencasts.

## 2Or3
This guide focuses only on Python3, Python2 is on life support and we do not recommend using it, unless there is an exceptional scenario.

## Writing Style

We have thirteen chapters:

* Each chapter has an associated YouTube screencast. 
* Each chapter has concepts explained by an example (can be as stupid as 1+1=2)
* Code that is supposed to run on the Interpreter starts with `>>>` like `>>> not True`. In this case, `>>> not True` is the statement and `False` is the output.
```Python
>>> not True
	False
```
* Code that doesn't start with `>>>` is supposed to be run in a file of the extension .py
* If there is significant code for the chapter, you can find a file in the code repository, please look on the basis of chapters.

## How to use?
* Read the chapters end to end.
* Watch the YouTube screencast, there is a reason why they are free!
* Do NOT search the Internet for things like "how to do X in python", use the documentation.
