## What is this?
An easy to understand introduction to the Python programming language by using examples. You will build a command line iodo list manager after you understand the basics of the language. Please have a Python 3 interpreter with you because you'll need to run code as you read! 


## Why Python?
There are a large number of languages out there and new coming out new week, so this question is important, _why learn Python_ over X. There is one simple answer for this, Python is an open source language having a very wide adoption and it has one of the simplest syntaxes of all languages, it feels like writing English. You can quickly write programs to solve problems in Python (it takes less number of lines and less time for writing a Python script).

## Installation
For Linux and Mac, congrats! You already have Python installed, use your package manager in Linux to install the `python3` package, and brew for Mac. 

For Windows, you can download the `.msi` or `.exe` file from https://python.org, run the installer, click on Next Next until it finishes.

For Android, install `termux` & run `apt-get install python3` to install python inside it.

## Background
This tutorial is the culmination of the Python trainings I have given in the past. As I took the trainings, I found out that a lot of newcomers coming to Python are overwhelmed by the existing tutorials and books.

There are many guides for Python, but I never did find a guide which explained by example with the minimal theory and at the same time didn't overwhelm the reader. As someone said, "If your dream book hasn't been written, write it!", hence I started to write this guide. 

I don't profess that I am an expert in Python, I am having decent knowledge of it, I LOVE Python, it has made me a better programmer and a better person, there was a time when I used to wish for having access to my home in Python, I could do, home.find("remote")and get the location of my tv remote :-D (I don't own or watch TV, but you get the point). 

It was my dream to write a tutorial on Python ever since I got introduced to the language, purely by accident some six years ago. Finally, I was able to write it! 

## Multiversity
This guide is a part of the [Multiversity](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/multiversity) initiative. The aim is to have high quality open source tutorials along with screencasts.

## 2Or3
This guide focuses only on Python3, Python2 is on life support and we do not recommend using it, unless there is an exceptional scenario.

## Writing Style

We have thirteen chapters:

* Each chapter has an associated YouTube screencast. 
* Each chapter has concepts explained by an example (can be as stupid as 1+1=2)
* Code that is supposed to run on the Interpreter starts with `>>>` like `>>> not True`. In this case, `>>> not True` is the statement and `False` is the output.
```Python
>>> not True
	False
```
* Code that doesn't start with `>>>` is supposed to be run in a file of the extension .py
* If there is significant code for the chapter, you can find a file in the code repository, please look on the basis of chapters.

## How to use?
* Read the chapters end to end.
* Watch the YouTube screencast, there is a reason why they are free!
* Do NOT search the Internet for things like "how to do X in python", use the documentation.
